# Tic-Tac-Toe Java Swing Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Java Swing. The game features a graphical user interface with a 3x3 grid of buttons, allowing two players to take turns marking their symbol (X or O) until a winner is determined or the game ends in a tie.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/patelpratyush/TicTacToe.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

3. Compile and run the Tic_Tac_Toe.java file to start the game.

4. The game window will appear, displaying the Tic-Tac-Toe grid. Players can take turns by clicking on an empty cell to place their symbol.

5. The game will announce the winner when a player achieves three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If no winner is determined, the game will end in a tie.

6. Click the "Reset" button to start a new game.
